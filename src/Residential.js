            <p className='resident'>Taking on a design project independently can be complicated, time-consuming, and sometimes overwhelming. To ensure that the time, energy, and financial investment you make in your home is sound, many folks find it very beneficial to work with a professional interior designer. At MI, we tailor our interior design services to your specific needs, delivering spaces that are both relevant and enduring, no matter the scope.</p>
            <p className='resident'>Our design process is centered around you — the client.  We do not cater to passing trends nor do we mimic the same style in every project; instead, we apply a thoughtful exploration of your aesthetic, values, and lifestyle. We use a “five senses” design approach, honing in on how you want to feel when you walk in your space and using interior design as a tool to translate that feeling into the three-dimensional world. </p>
